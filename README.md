Leaflet click-to-add-marker "app"
===========

A simpler version, and arguably less secure and less verifiable, version of the "User submitted leaflet" app.

Goal is to provide a right-click-to-add-marker app and circumvent the need to type in address, this would allow users to pinpoint locations that may not be address-friendly (such as potholes on roads, they're not exactly easy to mark with an address).

Current status
===========

Far from being complete. Below is the general to-do-list.

* Proper CloudMade tiles and API set-up
* Record markers on either Google Docs spreadsheets or a proper database
* Fire right-click events (currently left-click events)
* Right-click form for details and/or photo upload
* Photo upload and hosting and presentation
